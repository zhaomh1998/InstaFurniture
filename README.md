### User stories
```
1. User story 1
As a student just arrive the campus,I have to go through the pain of moving in the new apartment, buying new furniture is expensive given that we only use them for one or two years, but for used ones, it’s difficult to find someone we trust on craigslist or facebook marketplace. 
Thus I want to have access to a list of second-hard furniture that caters to my needs and is close to my neighborhood or campus.
So that I can purchase them within a very short period of time


2. User story 2
As a student about to move out from the apartment, it’s not only a waste but also not environmentally-friendly to throw them away, furniture is not something we can throw in trash cans or dumpsters, sometimes we even need to pay for someone to dispose
Thus I want a platform that enables me to easily upload furniture item pictures, along with brief descriptions(title, labels, zip code) and contact information.
So that I can help find buyers who are interested in my used furniture and sell them, minimize the cost of disposing used furniture and protect the environment
